	#  The following config items can be used in each of the sections.
	#  The sections themselves reflect the sections in the server.
	#  For example if you list rest in the authorize section of a virtual server,
	#  the settings from the authorize section here will be used.
	#
	#  The following config items may be listed in any of the sections:
	#    uri          - to send the request to.
	#    method       - HTTP method to use, one of 'get', 'post', 'put', 'patch',
	#                   'delete' or any custom HTTP method.
	#    body         - The format of the HTTP body sent to the remote server.
	#                   May be 'none', 'post' or 'json', defaults to 'none'.
	#    data         - Send custom freeform data in the HTTP body. Content-type
	#                   may be specified with 'body'. Will be expanded.
	#                   Values from expansion will not be escaped, this should be
	#                   done using the appropriate xlat method e.g. %{urlencode:<attr>}.
	#    force_to     - Force the response to be decoded with this decoder.
	#                   May be 'plain' (creates reply:REST-HTTP-Body), 'post'
	#                   or 'json'.
	#    tls          - TLS settings for HTTPS.
	#    auth         - HTTP auth method to use, one of 'none', 'srp', 'basic',
	#                   'digest', 'digest-ie', 'gss-negotiate', 'ntlm',
	#                   'ntlm-winbind', 'any', 'safe'. defaults to 'none'.
	#    username     - User to authenticate as, will be expanded.
	#    password     - Password to use for authentication, will be expanded.
	#    require_auth - Require HTTP authentication.
	#    timeout      - HTTP request timeout in seconds, defaults to 4.0.
	#
	#  Additional HTTP headers may be specified with control:REST-HTTP-Header.
	#  The values of those attributes should be in the format:
	#
	#    control:REST-HTTP-Header := "<HTTP attribute>: <value>"
	#
	#  The control:REST-HTTP-Header attributes will be consumed
	#  (i.e. deleted) after each call to the rest module, and each
	#  %{rest:} expansion.  This is so that headers from one REST
	#  call do not affect headers from a different REST call.

	#
	#  Body encodings are the same for requests and responses
	#
	#  POST - All attributes and values are urlencoded
	#  [outer.][<list>:]<attribute0>=<value0>&[outer.][<list>:]<attributeN>=<valueN>
	#
	#  JSON - All attributes and values are escaped according to the JSON specification
	#  {
	#      "<attribute0>":{
	#          "type":"<type0>",
	#          "value":[<value0>,<value1>,<valueN>]

	#  The response format adds three optional fields:
	#  - do_xlat	If true, any values will be xlat expanded. Defaults to true.
	#  - is_json	If true, any nested JSON data will be copied to the attribute
	#               in string form. Defaults to true.
	#  - op	        Controls how the attribute is inserted into the target list.
	#               Defaults to ':='. To create multiple attributes from multiple
	#               values, this should be set to '+=', otherwise only the last
	#               value will be used, and it will be assigned to a single
	#               attribute.
